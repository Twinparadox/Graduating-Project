## Getting Started

In order to use this project, you'll need to install the required python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can open up a terminal and start training the agent:

```bash
python train.py data/SS.csv data/SS_2018.csv --strategy dqn
```

Once you're done training, run the evaluation script and let the agent make trading decisions:

```bash
python eval.py data/SS_2019.csv --model-name model_debug_50 --debug
```

Now you are all set up!
